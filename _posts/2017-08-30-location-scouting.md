Today myself and Maggie, our DP, went location scouting! I had a few ideas in mind already and with the script fairly clear about what we needed, I think it went quite smoothly. The hardest part about this production is that there are so many locations. Over 11 minutes, we need five (5) locations:

- A police office
- An apartment
- A driveway/house in a nice suburb
- A cafe
- A large, empty carpark

Way to make things easy for yourself, Chloe! One of the first things I was taught when I did the correspondence Diploma was that you should write minimally. As in, if you have no/low budget, write one location. Write one actor. Two at the most—keep your logistics minimal. It reduces cost, manpower, and time.

Of course, in typical style, I threw all that out the window. What can I say. I honestly believe I pared back as much as I could to tell the story and still make it viable to shoot. Would you believe that the initial draft had 8 locations?! I mean, really Chloe. Control yourself.

It was also really good to have Maggie along. I’m learning a lot over the process of preparing for this shoot and one thing that I already knew about myself, but was definitely reinforced recently and today, is that I struggle to form mental images. That’s such a funny thing, because… filmmaking is, of course, a visual medium. It was really handy to have her to structure my thoughts and clarify my vision, and point out the logistics in making it work. She’s super busy with her own short film so I really appreciated having her take the time out this morning.

_Drive-by shooting. Holding up traffic! Accidentally of course. Maggie prefers to be behind the camera as much as I do_
